Like the Stream Deck, but using a Raspberry Pi 4, and configured using Python, and the UI built using PySide6.

## Todo
[ ] Add the "ping" command on the Pi4 side.
[ ] Make an actual API for the host side.
[ ] Make it automatically detect the port on (atleast) the host side.
[ ] Add more options to ui button (ie font size, etc.).
